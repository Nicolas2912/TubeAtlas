# Task Report: Build Repository Layer with CRUD Operations (Task 2.4)

## 1 – Objective & Requirements
Implement a clean **Repository layer** on top of the SQLAlchemy ORM models created in Task 2.3.
Each repository must expose asynchronous **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)** operations as well as common convenience look-ups while hiding SQLAlchemy details from the service / API layers.

## 2 – What Was Done
1. **Created two new repository classes**
   * `TranscriptRepository` ‑ CRUD + `list_by_channel` helper.
   * `ProcessingTaskRepository` ‑ CRUD + helpers `list_by_status`, `list_pending`.
2. **Augmented package exports** in `src/tubeatlas/repositories/__init__.py` so all repositories can be imported directly:
   ```python
   from tubeatlas.repositories import TranscriptRepository, ProcessingTaskRepository
   ```
3. **Ensured symmetry** – existing `VideoRepository` and `KnowledgeGraphRepository` already followed the same pattern; the new classes mirror their implementation, leveraging the shared `BaseRepository` ABC.
4. **Type safety & documentation** – added generics, doc-strings and `type: ignore[override]` markers where necessary to appease mypy.
5. **Updated documentation** – added this report and changed the status table in `docs/task-reports/README.md` from *PENDING* to *COMPLETED*.

## 3 – Implementation Details
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `src/tubeatlas/repositories/transcript_repository.py` | New repository for `Transcript` entities. |
| `src/tubeatlas/repositories/processing_task_repository.py` | New repository for `ProcessingTask` entities. |
| `src/tubeatlas/repositories/__init__.py` | Re-export all repository classes for ergonomic imports. |

### CRUD Pattern (excerpt)
```python
class TranscriptRepository(BaseRepository[Transcript]):
    async def create(self, entity: Transcript) -> Transcript:
        self.session.add(entity)
        await self.session.commit()
        await self.session.refresh(entity)
        return entity
```
The same pattern is applied across all repositories ensuring predictable behaviour.

## 4 – Verification & Testing
* **Static analysis** – `mypy` passes with no new errors.
* **Unit smoke-test** – instantiated each repository inside an isolated `AsyncSession` and verified `create`/`get` round-trip operations.
* **Integration** – existing tests (`tests/test_models.py`, `tests/test_database.py`) still pass, confirming schema compatibility.

## 5 – Problems Encountered & Solutions
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Generic `BaseRepository` did not provide default implementations. | Implemented concrete CRUD logic per repository using async SQLAlchemy session – keeps Base abstract and flexible. |
| Potential duplicated helper methods across repositories. | Added only minimal helpers now (`list_by_channel`, `list_by_status`). Additional domain-specific queries will be implemented in future tasks to avoid YAGNI. |

## 6 – Quality Assurance
* Followed **single-responsibility principle** – repositories deal only with persistence logic.
* Ensured **type annotations** and **PEP 257** compliant doc-strings.
* Maintained **consistent coding style** across repository modules.

## 7 – Impact & Next Steps
The service and API layers can now depend on these repositories for database access without touching SQLAlchemy directly.
This unblocks **Task 2.5 – Integrate Health-check Middleware and Startup Hooks** and future business-logic tasks that require data persistence.

✅ **Task 2.4 completed – Repository layer is production-ready.**
