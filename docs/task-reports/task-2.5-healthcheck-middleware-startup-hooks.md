# Task 2.5: Integrate Healthcheck Middleware and Startup Hooks into FastAPI

## Task Overview

**Task ID:** 2.5
**Title:** Integrate Healthcheck Middleware and Startup Hooks into FastAPI
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Parent Task:** 2. Implement Database Schema & ORM Models
**Dependencies:** Task 1 (Project Setup), Task 4 (Database Repository Layer)

## Task Description

Add middleware/endpoints to verify DB connectivity and ensure tables are created at application startup.

### Requirements
- Add startup hooks with database table creation and connectivity testing
- Implement middleware catching DB exceptions and transforming into 503 errors
- Add `/health/db` endpoint that tests database connectivity
- Register middleware and endpoint with FastAPI

## Implementation Details

### 1. Application Lifespan Management

**File:** `src/tubeatlas/main.py`

Implemented modern FastAPI lifespan management using `@asynccontextmanager` pattern (replacing deprecated `@app.on_event`):

**Key Features:**
- Automatic database table creation on startup
- Database connectivity verification with `SELECT 1` test
- Proper error handling and logging
- Clean shutdown with connection disposal

### 2. Database Health Middleware

**File:** `src/tubeatlas/api/middleware/database.py`

Implemented `DatabaseHealthMiddleware` that catches database-related exceptions and transforms them into proper HTTP 503 responses.

**Key Features:**
- Catches SQLAlchemy database exceptions (`DatabaseError`, `DisconnectionError`, `TimeoutError`)
- Transforms to structured 503 HTTP responses
- Logs errors for monitoring
- Passes through non-database exceptions unchanged

### 3. Health Check Endpoints

**File:** `src/tubeatlas/api/routes/health.py`

Implemented comprehensive health check endpoints:
- `/health/` - Basic health check with app status, version, environment
- `/health/db` - Database connectivity check using `SELECT 1` query

### 4. FastAPI Integration

**File:** `src/tubeatlas/main.py`

Properly integrated all components with the FastAPI application:
- Added lifespan manager for startup/shutdown
- Registered DatabaseHealthMiddleware before CORS
- Included health router

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
**File:** `tests/test_health_checks.py`

**Test Results:** ✅ 4/4 tests passing

### 2. Manual Integration Testing

Verified endpoints manually with running server:
- ✅ `/health/` - Basic health check working
- ✅ `/health/db` - Database connectivity test working
- ✅ Root endpoint includes health check links

## Verification Results

### ✅ Startup Hooks
- Database tables are created automatically on application startup
- Database connectivity is verified with `SELECT 1` test
- Proper error handling and logging implemented
- Clean shutdown with connection disposal

### ✅ Health Middleware
- `DatabaseHealthMiddleware` properly catches SQLAlchemy database exceptions
- Transforms database errors to structured 503 HTTP responses
- Logs errors for monitoring and debugging
- Passes through non-database exceptions unchanged

### ✅ Health Endpoints
- `/health/` provides basic application health status
- `/health/db` tests actual database connectivity
- Proper error handling with 503 responses for failures

### ✅ Integration
- All components properly registered with FastAPI application
- Modern lifespan management instead of deprecated event handlers
- Health check links included in root endpoint response

## Files Created/Modified

### Created Files:
- `src/tubeatlas/api/middleware/database.py` - Database health middleware
- `src/tubeatlas/api/routes/health.py` - Health check endpoints
- `tests/test_health_checks.py` - Test suite for health functionality

### Modified Files:
- `src/tubeatlas/main.py` - Added lifespan management, middleware, and health routes
- `src/tubeatlas/api/middleware/__init__.py` - Export new middleware

## Conclusion

Task 2.5 has been successfully implemented with a comprehensive, production-ready health monitoring infrastructure. The implementation includes:

1. **Modern FastAPI lifespan management** for startup/shutdown hooks
2. **Database health middleware** that transforms DB errors to proper HTTP responses
3. **Comprehensive health check endpoints** for basic and database connectivity monitoring
4. **Proper integration** with the FastAPI application
5. **Thorough testing** with 100% test pass rate

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE AND VERIFIED**
