# Task 3.5: Persist Video & Transcript Data with Upsert and Incremental Mode

Date: 2025-06-27

## Task Description

The objective of this sub-task was to store YouTube video metadata and the corresponding transcript in the database while –

1. avoiding duplicate rows (***upsert*** behaviour) and
2. supporting an ***incremental*** processing mode that stops fetching as soon as an already-persisted video is encountered (assuming the YouTube API returns videos in reverse chronological order).

## Implementation Details

### 1. Repository Enhancements

| Repository | Additions |
|------------|-----------|
| `src/tubeatlas/repositories/video_repository.py` | • `exists(video_id)` – quick existence check
• `upsert(data)` – insert-or-update logic with column filtering to ensure only valid model fields are written |
| `src/tubeatlas/repositories/transcript_repository.py` | Same additions as *VideoRepository* with primary-key `video_id` |

Both `upsert` implementations:
* Filter uncontrolled input to **valid mapped columns** using `Video.__table__.columns` / `Transcript.__table__.columns`.
* Commit and refresh in a single DB round-trip.

### 2. `TranscriptService` Refactor

* Added optional `session` and `youtube_service` to the constructor.
  * Repository imports are now executed **only when a session is supplied**, preventing test-time metadata collisions.
* Implemented `process_channel_transcripts(…)`:
  1. Iterates over `YouTubeService.fetch_channel_videos(…)`.
  2. Performs incremental short-circuit if `update_existing=False` and the first existing video is detected.
  3. Upserts the **Video** row.
  4. Calls `get_transcript` → builds `Transcript` row → upserts.
  5. Returns a summary dict with created / updated / skipped counters.
* Removed the outer `session.begin()` wrapper to avoid nested transaction errors; repository methods manage their own commits.

### 3. Backwards-Compatibility Fixes

* Made `TranscriptService` instantiation without a session possible for the existing transcript unit tests.
* Moved repository imports inside the session-guarded block to avoid **`Table 'knowledge_graphs' is already defined`** errors during repeated model registration.

## Verification & Testing

New test file: **`tests/unit/test_persistence.py`**

| Test | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `test_video_repository_upsert` | Ensures `upsert` inserts and then updates without creating duplicates. |
| `test_process_channel_transcripts_incremental` | Uses an in-memory SQLite DB + fake YouTubeService to:
1. Pre-insert *vid1*
2. Confirm incremental stop with `update_existing=False` (no new rows)
3. Re-run with `update_existing=True` and verify the existing row is updated. |

All **52** unit tests now pass:
```
$ poetry run pytest tests/unit/
================================ 52 passed in 0.68s ================================
```

## Impact

The application can now safely run repeated ingestion jobs without duplicating data and can perform incremental updates for efficiency. The service architecture remains test-friendly and future tasks (e.g., analysis pipelines) can rely on consistent persisted data.
