# Task 3.3: Develop TranscriptService to download transcripts with fallback logic

Date: 2024-06-27

## Task Description

The goal of this task was to implement the `TranscriptService` to download video transcripts from YouTube. The key requirements were to use the `youtube-transcript-api` library, implement a robust fallback logic for selecting a transcript, handle various error conditions, and return the data in a standardized, structured format.

## Implementation Details

I implemented the `get_transcript` method within the `src/tubeatlas/services/transcript_service.py` file. This method serves as the core of the transcript fetching logic.

### Key Features:

1.  **Structured Data with `TypedDict`**: To ensure a consistent and type-safe data structure, I defined two `TypedDict` classes:
    *   `TranscriptSegment`: Represents a single line of the transcript with `text`, `start` time, and `duration`.
    *   `Transcript`: Represents the full, structured result, including a `status` field, the `video_id`, and details about the transcript like `language_code`, `is_generated`, and a list of `segments`.

2.  **Fallback Logic**: The service now intelligently selects the best available transcript according to the following priority:
    1.  A transcript in one of the user-specified preferred languages (defaulting to `['en']`).
    2.  If none of the preferred languages are available, it searches for any **manually created** transcript.
    3.  If no manual transcript is found, it falls back to the **first available transcript** in the list provided by the API, which often includes auto-generated ones.

3.  **Robust Error Handling**: The implementation wraps API calls in `try...except` blocks to gracefully handle common issues:
    *   `TranscriptsDisabled`: If transcripts are disabled for a video, the service returns a `status` of `'disabled'`.
    *   `NoTranscriptFound`: If no transcripts exist for the video, it returns a `status` of `'not_found'`.
    *   **Fetch Errors**: Any other exception during the final fetch of transcript segments is caught, and the service returns a `status` of `'fetch_error'`.

4.  **Standardized Return Object**: The `get_transcript` method no longer returns `None` on failure. Instead, it always returns the `Transcript` dictionary. The `status` field clearly indicates the outcome of the operation (`'success'`, `'disabled'`, `'not_found'`, `'fetch_error'`), allowing the calling code to react accordingly without needing to handle `None` values.

### Code Example (`get_transcript` return structure):

```python
# On Success
{
    "status": "success",
    "video_id": "some_video_id",
    "language_code": "en",
    "is_generated": False,
    "segments": [{"text": "Hello world", "start": 0.5, "duration": 1.2}]
}

# On Failure (e.g., transcripts disabled)
{
    "status": "disabled",
    "video_id": "some_video_id",
    "language_code": None,
    "is_generated": None,
    "segments": None
}
```

## Verification

The implementation was developed to align with the subtask's requirements. The logic directly addresses the specified fallback strategy and error handling. The `extract_transcript` method, which was previously a placeholder, was updated to use the new, more robust `get_transcript` method, ensuring that existing functionality is improved. The structured return type makes the service's output predictable and easier to integrate with other parts of the application, such as the database repositories that will be developed in subsequent tasks.

To ensure the correctness and robustness of the `TranscriptService`, a comprehensive suite of unit tests was implemented in `tests/unit/test_transcript_service.py`. These tests use `pytest` and `unittest.mock` to isolate the service from the external `youtube-transcript-api`.

Key test scenarios covered:
-   **Successful Retrieval**: Verifies that a transcript is correctly fetched when the preferred language is available.
-   **Fallback Logic**:
    -   Tests the fallback to the next available **manually created** transcript if the preferred language is not found.
    -   Tests the fallback to the **first available transcript** (even if generated) when no manual transcripts are present.
-   **Error Handling**:
    -   Asserts that the service returns a `'disabled'` status when a `TranscriptsDisabled` exception is raised.
    -   Asserts a `'not_found'` status for `NoTranscriptFound` exceptions.
    -   Confirms a `'fetch_error'` status when an unexpected exception occurs during the final fetch operation.
-   **Helper Method**: The `extract_transcript` helper method was also tested to ensure it correctly concatenates segments on success and returns `None` on failure.

All tests are passing, confirming that the service behaves as expected across various success and failure scenarios.
