# Task ID: 10
# Title: Comprehensive Testing, Coverage & CI Enforcement
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Achieve 90%+ coverage, performance, integration and e2e tests, wired into CI.
# Details:
1. Expand pytest suite: unit, integration (with sqlite tmp db), e2e (spin API + worker via docker-compose).
2. Use pytest-cov; fail if coverage <90%.
3. Add locust or k6 script for load tests (100 concurrent users) and include in CI (nightly job).
4. Static analysis gate: mypy ‑-strict, flake8, black ‑-check.
5. Generate HTML coverage report artifact.
6. Update GitHub Action to cache dependencies, parallel test matrix (py3.11, py3.12-beta).


# Test Strategy:
• `pytest -n auto` passes with >90% coverage.
• Load test yields average latency <2s and error rate <0.1%.
• Static type check passes with zero `error:` lines.
• Merge request blocked automatically on failure.
