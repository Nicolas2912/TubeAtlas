			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand task 5 into ~8 subtasks that cover: transcript retrieval & chunking integration, LangChain GraphPrompter prompt engineering, triple merging/deduplication logic, JSON/GraphML persistence layer, channel-level aggregation routine, cost-tracking instrumentation, public API function wiring, and unit/integration test suite.",
			"reasoning": "Requires orchestration of LLM calls, graph data structures, cost accounting, and persistence; moderate external dependencies but bounded scope."

			"taskTitle": "Implement Asynchronous Background Processing Framework",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand task 6 into ~7 subtasks including: Celery & Redis setup, task wrappers for existing services, progress/state update hooks, retry/back-off policy, Celery beat scheduling, Docker-compose updates, and integration tests.",
			"reasoning": "Multiple moving pieces (workers, broker, task lifecycle) but follows well-known patterns; moderate complexity."

			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Develop FastAPI REST API Layer",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand task 7 into ~8 subtasks: FastAPI app scaffolding, middleware/security setup, router implementations (transcripts, knowledge graphs, tasks), websocket progress channel, rate-limiting integration, error handling utilities, OpenAPI documentation polishing, and endpoint test coverage.",
			"reasoning": "Standard web API work with some real-time and security considerations; complexity is moderate but predictable."

			"taskTitle": "Implement Chat & RAG Query Service",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand task 8 into ~10 subtasks: session & history management, ContextAssembler implementation, embedding generation batching, vector search (FAISS/keyword/graph/temporal), ranking & fusion logic, LLM answer synthesis with citations, channel-wide summarization fallback, API endpoints, load/performance tuning, and comprehensive tests.",
			"reasoning": "Combines multiple retrieval strategies, stateful chat logic, and performance constraints—high integration and algorithmic complexity."

			"taskTitle": "Comprehensive Testing, Coverage & CI Enforcement",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand task 10 into ~9 subtasks: unit test expansion, integration test harness, e2e docker-compose runner, coverage gating, load-test script, static analysis setup, CI workflow matrix, artifacts & reporting, and nightly regression job.",
			"reasoning": "Touches all components, introduces automation and quality gates; high coordination effort but limited novel algorithms."
